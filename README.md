1. Forecasting Models Implementation: Use Python to implement the following forecasting models:
    1. Single Exponential Smoothing
    2. Double Exponential Smoothing
    3. Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters Method)
    4. Linear Regression
2. Data Analysis:
    - Download the demand data from the Excel file “HW 5 – ES and LR”.
    - Apply your Python codes to run each of the four forecasting models on the provided demand data. Assume alpha = 0.5, beta = 0.35, gamma = 0.6, and N = 4 (four periods in a season)
    - Calculate performance measurements for each model, including:
      
        ➢Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
        ➢Mean Squared Error (MSE)
        ➢Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
3. Results Compilation:
    - Compile the forecasting results and performance measurements into an Excel file named “Results.xlsx”.
